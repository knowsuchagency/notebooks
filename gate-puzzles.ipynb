    "\"Likeness\" coefficient for two words is measured in percentages using the following rules:\n",
    "- Letter case does not matter (\"A\" == \"a\");\n",
    "- If the first letters of the words are equal, then add 10%;\n",
    "- If the last letters of the words are equal, then add 10%;\n",
    "- Add length comparison as \n",
    "(length_of_word1 / length_of_word2) * 30%, if length_of_word1 ≤ length_of_word2;\n",
    ", else (length_of_word2 / length_of_word1) * 30%\n",
    "- Take all unique letters from the both words in one set and count how many letters appear in the both words. Add to the coefficient (common_letter_number / unique_letters_numbers) * 50;\n",
    "\n",
    "So the maximum coefficient of likeness is 100%. For example: for the words \"Bread\" and \"Beard\".\n",
    "The result should be given in the lower case.\n",
    "Let's look at an example. The message \"Friend Fred and friend Ted.\" First, pick out words - (\"friend\", \"fred\", \"and\", \"friend\", \"ted\"). Next we calculate \"likeness\" for the first word with other. __\"friend\" and \"fred\" have the same first and last letters, so add 20.__ __Then length comparison: the length of \"fred\" is lesser than \"friend\", so add (4/6)*30=20.__ __The last rule: for these words unique letters are \"definr\" and the intersected letters are \"defr\". So add (4/6)*50≈33.333. And the summary is 73.333.__\n",
    "This way we will count all other coefficients and get the following table (results are rounded just for simplicity). The greatest average is 62.976 and the result is \"friend\"."
